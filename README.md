The google-chart directives (on the dashboard) do not seem to be rendering. There was an angular dependancy issue when installing the `angular-google-charts` package, and it seems the charts are not working correctly.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
